# wildoceans-scripts
This repository contains all the necessary code to build the shark and ray conservation plan developed for WILDOCEANS. This is currently a LIVE project so the code is not in its final and clean form. It is continuously changing.

# folders
there are two main folders. One with the code to run the species distribution models and the other to run the spatial planning algorithm using prioritizr. there is also a third folder which contains the scripts used to clean and format the occurence data. The occurence data in itself is confidential but the scripts may be useful to see how it was cleaned and formatted.
