# wildoceans-scripts
This repository contains all the necessary code to build the shark and ray conservation plan developed for WILDOCEANS. This is currently a LIVE project so the code is not in its final and clean form. It is continuously changing.

# folders
there are two main folders. One with the code to run the species distribution models and the other to run the spatial planning algorithm using prioritizr.
